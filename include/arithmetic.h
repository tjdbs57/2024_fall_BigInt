 * @param[in] B Second word to add.

/**
 * @brief Adds two big integers and stores the result in a third bigint.
 *
 * This function takes two big integers represented as `bigint` structures, 
 * adds them together, and stores the resulting bigint in a third `bigint`.
 * It ensures that both numbers have the same length by padding with zeros 
 * if necessary. The addition is performed in reverse order to handle 
 * carry appropriately.
 *
 * @param[in] x Pointer to the first bigint to add.
 * @param[in] y Pointer to the second bigint to add.
 * @param[out] z Pointer to the result bigint where the sum will be stored.
 *
 * This function performs the following steps:
 * - Determines the lengths of the input big integers.
 * - Allocates memory for the result bigint based on the maximum length of the inputs.
 * - Iteratively adds each corresponding word from the two input big integers,
 *   starting from the least significant word, while handling any carry from previous additions.
 * - Stores the result in the appropriate position in the result bigint.
 * - Handles any carry that may remain after the final addition.
 * - Calls `bi_refine` to remove any leading zeros from the result.
 *
 * @note The input big integers should be properly initialized and should not be NULL.
 *       The result bigint will be allocated and must be freed by the caller when no longer needed.
